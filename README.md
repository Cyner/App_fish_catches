# App_fish_catches
1. The user starts the application and provides a video or image of a fish catch.
2. The application uses the OpenCV library to process the video or image and extract individual frames from the video, or individual fish from the image.
3. The extracted frames or fish images are passed to a fish recognition model, which is trained using a dataset of fish images and labels. The model uses machine learning algorithms to make predictions on each frame or fish image.
The predictions made by the model, along with the video or image data, are passed to a dimension and weight calculation module. This module uses image processing algorithms to calculate the dimensions and weight of each fish.
The fish data (predictions, dimensions, and weight) is saved to Azure Storage using the Azure Storage API.
The fish data saved in Azure Storage is used to train the fish recognition model using the Azure Machine Learning API. This allows the model to improve its accuracy over time.
The fish data is analyzed using the Azure Machine Learning API to generate insights about the fish catch. This may include information such as the total number of fish, the dimensions and weight of each fish, and the species of each fish.
The results of the analysis are presented to the user via a user interface. The user can view the information about the fish catch and use this information as needed.
This design provides a scalable and efficient architecture for the application. It allows the application to process video or image data, make predictions using a trained model, calculate dimensions and weight, save and analyze the data using Azure, and present the results to the user.
